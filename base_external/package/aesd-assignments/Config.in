config BR2_PACKAGE_AESD_ASSIGNMENTS
	bool "aesd-assignments"
	help
	  Includes the writer executable, finder.sh and tester.sh in the kernel image.
	  Used to understand buildroot external trees and package builds.

config BR2_CCACHE
	bool "Enable compiler cache"
	help
	  This option will enable the use of ccache, a compiler cache.
	  It will cache the result of previous builds to speed up future
	  builds. By default, the cache is stored in
	  $HOME/.buildroot-ccache.

	  Note that Buildroot does not try to invalidate the cache
	  contents when the compiler changes in an incompatible way.
	  Therefore, if you make a change to the compiler version and/or
	  configuration, you are responsible for purging the ccache
	  cache by removing the $HOME/.buildroot-ccache directory.
